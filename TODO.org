#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration Todo List

* TODO Improve =init.el= organization
- [ ] Load packages with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][=use-package=]]
- [ ] Use =customize= [fn:1] with [[https://github.com/dabrahams/initsplit][=initsplit=]]

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Having multiple calls to =custom-set-variables= caused
problems in older versions of Emacs, as detailed [[http://dotemacs.de/custbuffer.html][here]]. In short, the
last call sets the variable but the customize buffer saves its value
to the first one encountered. But now this no longer seems to be the
case.
