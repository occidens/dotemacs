#+TITLE: William West's Emacs Configuration

A long time ago, Ovid is said to have issued the following warning
about Emacs configuration files:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/Adde parvum parvo magnus acervus erit./

Add little to little and there will be a big pile.
#+END_QUOTE

My Emacs configuration is currently a Big Pile. I do not recommend
cribbing anything from here, with the possible exception of the method
I use to get =org-plus-contrib= to always load, if present, even if
=org= is present.

If you are looking for sources of inspiration for your own Emacs
configuration, I suggest the following people's repositories as a
starting point, which represent a good range of approaches to the
problem:

- [[https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d][Magnar Sveen]]
- [[https://github.com/jwiegley/dot-emacs][John Wiegley]]
- [[https://github.com/hrs/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs.d][Harry R. Schwartz]]
- [[https://github.com/sachac/.emacs.d][Sacha Chua]]
- [[https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/dotemacs][Ryan C. Thompson]]
